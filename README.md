## Features
### Questions
Users can ask questions to the community (anyone) regarding coding problems
Answers

Users can answer questions, but the answers are incentivized (see incentivization) to be long form articles that explain the entirety of the question in detail.

#### Why?
Long form answers have the potential to answer many questions rather than one very specific question. While it’s nice to get a quick answer, it’s also nice to know the reasoning why that’s the answer in detail. There are many times that I find an answer on Stack Overflow that works, but I continue to search for more detail so that I fully understand the underlying issue.

By fully answering the question in one place, the site becomes a breeding ground for great developer articles similar to how medium changed blogging by incentivizing quality writing. 

#### Incentivization
Developers will be incentivized to write good articles by being rewarded for their work. You’ll receive $1 per 1000 views of the article up to $100 per article.

## Article Ranking
In order to determine which article (answer) is chosen, all answers will receive a page as the answer which will be indexed by google. Once a page reaches 1000 unique views, all other pages will be discontinued.

The goal is to discourage the toxicity that Stack Overflow can sometimes be. No user ratings in the form of upvoting or downvoting will be allowed. In the business world we let the markets decide the winner, and in this world, the community will ultimately decide the winner instead of the trolls.
